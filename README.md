## Short Description
This project analyzes how workplace factors influence mental health among tech professionals. Using data from the OSMI Mental Health in Tech Survey, it applies statistical and machine learning methods to identify key predictors of treatment seeking behavior and specific disorders such as anxiety and depression. The study emphasizes the importance of organizational support such as mental health benefits and flexible leave policies, and provides actionable insights for creating healthier work environments.
- Data cleaning & preprocessing
- Chi-square analysis for predictor significance
- Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM modeling
- Multi-label classification for predicting Anxiety, Depression, PTSD, and OCD
- SHAP-based feature importance
